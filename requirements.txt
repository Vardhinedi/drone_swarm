# Drone Swarm MVP Requirements
- Simulate 5 drones in AirSim
- Boid's flocking algorithm for swarm coordination
- YOLOv8 for threat detection (e.g., vehicles, 85%+ accuracy)
- PPO reinforcement learning for adaptive navigation
- Web dashboard with Flask and Plotly
- Metrics: Collision rate <5%, detection accuracy >85%
